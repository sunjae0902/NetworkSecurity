Project description
Python Cryptography Toolkit (pycrypto)

This is a collection of both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal, etc.). The package is structured to make adding new modules easy. This section is essentially complete, and the software interface will almost certainly not change in an incompatible way in the future; all that remains to be done is to fix any bugs that show up.
